# Frontend task

Just a bit of showcasing.

The initial aim was to use [react-grid-layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout).
You may see a commit where I experimented with it, but there was an issue with layout height not adjusting
to it's context and I could not find an straightforward way to resolve it.


## Tech:
* *Bootstrap*:

    Time is short and I don't want to deal with the minutiae of styling buttons and inputs.
    It is loaded as a minified css into the page via a cdn currently.
    I may also load the js if required.

* *Flexbox*:

    Will be using things to handle the layout.
    I could have used a grid library, but I'm only familiar with bootstrap's one and I don't want the code to showcase a bootstrap layout.

* *Webpack*:

    Used for the development server and to bundle the styles
