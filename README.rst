Frontend task resolution
========================

This code is my resolution for a frontend test I was required to tackle to to showcase may skills.

Tech:
-----
Bootstrap
    Time is short and I don't want to deal with the minutiae of styling buttons and inputs.
    I dont plant to use all of it, so I will be importing a few components.

Flexbox
    Will be using things to handle the layout.
    I could have used a grid library, but I'm only familiar with bootstrap's one and I don't want the code to showcase how good I am with it.
