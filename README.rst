Tech-tests
==========

This is a repo where a merge in and consolidate all coding challenges that I have done for job interviews or for whatever reason.

If you want to have a look, just swicht branches to inspect the code.

Those branches were small individual repos before, but I merged them in and arranged them in branches.
This is moslty because I didn't want a lot of stagnant repos mixed in with the repos for projects I actually enjoy working on.

Maybe some day I will merge it all in master, but only if I see a good enough reason for it.
