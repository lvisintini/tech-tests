Anagrams and chains
===================

A little code I wrote that play around with anagrams an chains

I coded this up as part of a job interview process.

Minimum requirements are:
-------------------------

- Given a file with random words on it, find and group up all the anagrams (same letters, same length, different word)
- Find the longest word chain in the file (goods -> good -> dog -> go)


Setup Instructions
------------------

This is a pure python exercise, but you may want to run the tests.
If so, do:

    git clone https://github.com/lvisintini/exercise-anagrams-and-chains.git
    cd ./exercise-anagrams-and-chains
    mkvirtualenv exercise-anagrams-and-chains
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    py.test tests.py
