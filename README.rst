Vowels and Consonants counter
=============================

A simple lib that counts letters on strings.

As part of a job interview process, I was requested to write a function that, given a string, would:

- For each vowel, a count of how many times it appears in the input
- A count of how many consonants appear in total in the input

Setup Instructions
------------------

Mostly vanilla., but added here for completeness sake::
  
  git clone https://github.com/lvisintini/exercise-chars-counter.git
  cd ./exercise-chars-counter
  mkvirtualenv exercise-chars-counter
  pip install -r requirements.txt


Tests
-----

There are a few. Run them with ``py.test tests.py``
