Search by age app
=================

This app's purpose is to search through a collection of artists.

I coded this up as part of a job interview process.

Minimum requirements are:

- find artists that match an age range (minimum to maximum) where results are ordered by best fit.
- the best fit algorithm is should favour artists with ages in the middle of the search range over those at either extreme of the range.
- output should be a JSON encoded structure with a list of matching artist UUIDs and ages.
